# Linked-List

This is a Ruby implementation of a linked list as part of The Odin Project.

The following LinkedList methods are as follows:

#append_data(value) adds a new node containing value to the end of the list
#prepend_data(value) adds a new node containing value to the start of the list
#size returns the total number of nodes in the list
#head returns the first node value in the list
#tail returns the last node value in the list
#at(index) returns the node value at the given index
#pop removes the last element from the list
#contains?(value) returns true if the passed in value is in the list and otherwise returns false.
#find(value) returns the index of the node containing value, or nil if not found.
#to_s represent the LinkedList objects as strings, so you can print them out and preview them in the console.
